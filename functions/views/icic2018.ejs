						<h4>Abstract</h4>
						<p>
							Machine Learning provides computers the ability to automatically learn and improve with data without being
							explicitly programmed. It is one of the hottest areas in computer technology today with a wide array of
							applications including self-driving cars, computer vision, natural language processing, ecommerce website
							recommendations, financial market analysis, robotics and so on. Machine Learning algorithms are typically
							categorized as supervised and unsupervised. In supervised machine learning, the system builds a model from
							labeled data sets and uses the model to make predictions on future input. In contrast, unsupervised machine
							learning algorithms attempt to discover hidden structures from unlabeled data sets.
							<br><br>
							In this tutorial, we will understand how machine learning differs from regular computer programming and some
							examples of the applications of machine learning. We will briefly explore the various types of machine learning
							algorithms. Then we will dive into a few hands-on illustrations of machine learning on sample data sets using
							Python. This will acquaint us with the key Python packages that are typically used for data preprocessing,
							statistical learning and data visualization. The tutorial will conclude with links to additional references for
							self study.

						<h4>Abstract</h4>
						<p>
							Eye is the index of mind and hence eye gaze data analytics can indicate the perception of human. With
							advancement in technology eye tracking is moving from the laboratory to real world, producing enormous data with
							different data types.
							The tutorial focuses on giving an insight to the Eye tracking Research at Amrita School of Engineering,
							Bengaluru. The objective of the session is to give researchers an exposure to the eye tracking data analysis and
							visualization using various open source and commercial eye tracking data analysis and visualization tools like
							OGAMA, SMI iViewX eye tracker and its experimental suite.

						<h4> Robotics & AI: Where are we headed next? </h4>
						<p>
							Modern science has grown multifold in this century. Technology is moving at breakneck speed. We have more
							technology in our pockets right now than we had in our homes in the 90s. The pereception is that robotic
							revolution happened in this decade but the reality is, it has been happening for decades. In it’s nascent stage,
							robotics fuelled the Industrial revolution in the 1960s. Today it is possible to envisage human sized robots
							with capacity for near human thought and movement. The lecture is going to highlight the revolution of robotics
							through the decades leading to the present day where the focus is around technology like artificial intelligence
							and humanoids. The lecture is also going to be supported by a product demonstration of humanoid and robotic
							products by Sirena Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru. The highlight of the demo is Nino - India’s only humanoid
							in the education sector. The humanoid is capable of walk, talk, movements and can be controlled through voice or
							app.
