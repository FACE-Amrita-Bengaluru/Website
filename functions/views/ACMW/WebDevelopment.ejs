			skills is always advantageous and web development helps you to gain
			programming skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., designing skills,
			SEO skills, and a lot more. Most importantly it helps you to build
			upon your resume helping you to have good prospects in the job. It

			The ACM chapter at Amrita invites all the creative and tech-savvy
			minds to test their skills in developing projects. Those who have no
			idea about web development can still join and they will be taught
			from scratch. Active participation is the key to SIG. We had
			conducted a boot camp on web development by two web development
			enthusiasts Aravind V Nair and Abhishek Sai. It was a full-stack web
			development workshop focusing on
