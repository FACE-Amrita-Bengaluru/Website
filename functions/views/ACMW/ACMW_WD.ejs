                The ACM chapter at Amrita invites all the creative and tech-savvy minds to test their skills in
                developing projects. Those who have no idea about web development can still join and they will be taught
                from scratch. Active participation is the key to SIG.

                We had conducted a boot camp on web development by two web development enthusiasts Aravind V Nair and
                Abhishek Sai. It was a full-stack web development workshop focusing on
                HTML5,CSS3,Bootcamp,Node.js,Express.js, GitHub, Database, CLI, JS, and Firebase.
                At last but not least our motto always here is to learn, unlearn and relearn.
