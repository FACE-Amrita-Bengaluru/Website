							Why is Web Development important for students?
						</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							Student life is a very crucial period. It is the
							place where students get exposed to different
							skills. Learning good skills that refine a student
							must be the first criterion of every student because
							education is not just bookish knowledge but to learn
							and explore skills that help them enhance their
							overall development.
						</p>

						<p class="card-text">
							A student with many skills is always advantageous
							and web development helps you to gain programming
							skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., designing
							skills, SEO skills, and a lot more. Most importantly
							it helps you to build upon your resume helping you
							to have good prospects in the job. It is not just a
							single skill but a cluster of many skills which a
							student can develop.

						What we do at ACM Web Development SIG?
					</h5>
					<p class="card-text">
						The ACM chapter at Amrita invites all the creative and
						tech-savvy minds to test their skills in developing
						projects. Those who have no idea about web development
						can still join and they will be taught from scratch.
						Active participation is the key to SIG.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
						We had conducted a boot camp on web development by two
						web development enthusiasts Aravind V Nair and Abhishek
						Sai. It was a full-stack web development workshop
						focusing on HTML5, CSS3, Bootcamp, Node.js, Express.js,
						GitHub, Database, CLI, JS, and Firebase. At last but not
						least our motto always here is to learn, unlearn and
						relearn.
